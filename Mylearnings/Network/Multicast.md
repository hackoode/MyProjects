### **IP Multicast Routing**

[***Introduction to IP Multicast Routing Paper - Stanford***](../Resources/Introduction_to_IP_Multicast_Routing.pdf)

The first part of this paper describes the benefits of multicasting, the Multicast Backbone
(MBONE), Class D addressing, and the operation of the Internet Group Management
Protocol (IGMP). 

The second section explores a number of different algorithms that
may potentially be employed by multicast routing protocols:

- Flooding
- Spanning Trees
- Reverse Path Broadcasting (RPB)
- Truncated Reverse Path Broadcasting (TRPB)
- Reverse Path Multicasting (RPM)
- Core-Based Trees

The third part contains the main body of the paper. It describes how the previous
algorithms are implemented in multicast routing protocols available today.
- Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)
- Multicast OSPF (MOSPF)
- Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM)
