## Process Management in OS

[***Linux Processes***](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Linux/linux_process_and_signals.php)

This blog from [bogotobogo.com](bogotobogo.com) describe processes in Linux OS in detail. Highly Recommended.

### Process Contents

[***Processes, Address Spaces, and Context Switches***](http://www.cse.iitm.ac.in/~chester/courses/15o_os/slides/6_Processes.pdf)

Insightful slides about processes from IIT.

### Process Control Block (PCB)

### Context Switch

Context Switching Overheads
- Direct Factors affecting context switching time
  - Timer Interrupt latency
  - Saving/restoring contexts
  - Finding the next process to execute
- Indirect factors
  - TLB needs to be reloaded
  - Loss of cache locality (therefore more cache misses)
  - Processor pipeline flush
